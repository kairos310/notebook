Ultrasonic backscatter techniques
transducer sends signal, backscatter from cancellous bone
encounter curved outer cortex first
	difficult to achieve perpendicular incidence
develop phantom that simulates bone, investigate effects of angle of incidents 
	use foam to simulate cancellous bone
mass density, speed of sound, frequency slope of attenuation
3.5 Mhz transducer

power spectrum 
reference spectrum from phantom signal, 
power averaged
power loss measuring
apparent integrated backscatter (AIB)
power in signal vs power with specimen



near field fresnel zone
far field fraunhofer zone

near field transducer has more variation 

specimen signal,
gate duration of tau
about 10 microseconds
compare that gate to reference signal
convert to power spectrum

reference signal is smooth
compared to measured is lower
subtract from the two to get ABTF apparent backscatter transfer function 
the AIB is the frequency averaged ABTF

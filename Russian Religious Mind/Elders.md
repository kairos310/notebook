asceticism --> theosis
	get rid of earthly desires a step towards the transfiguration
spiritual guidance necessary 
	can't rely on your own strength, to rely on the wisdom of others is humble wisdom
freedom by outward slavery
	complete submission to God's will, brings one closer to God, free of earthly desires, ego, constrains of pride and control, don't care about abasement is when you rise 
faith is a gift
	it's not stripping people of freedom, or responsibility, or decision making
	responsibility is a necessary condition for autonomy 
	being obedient to the will of God doesn't mean you're no longer responsible
	can't always be making good choices, this is a condition for freedom, if always doing the "right" thing, you don't have free will, need to have the impetus/ responsibility for making that choice
	it's still you that has the free will, you're trying to decern God's will, with the realization that it's still the individual that's acting

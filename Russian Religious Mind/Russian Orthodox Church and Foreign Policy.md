 1. Is the Russian Orthodox church a tool of the state
	 1. Russian orthodox church in foreign policy, increasing influence since the downfall of the soviet union. 
	 2. common casual assumption that because the ROC supports the Russian state in many arenas, derives from its subordination to the state, rather than a similarity of views. 
	 3. its eschatological agenda. By decentering the nation from our investigation, new light can be shed on the Church’s own approach to politics, and where it draws the line on cooperation with civil authorities. It is my contention that, in areas where the interests of the Church and the state overlap, the influence of the ROC in society is now such that it cannot be simply ignored. Moreover, as that influence has grown, the ROC has gained a greater **autonomy**, pursue its own agenda, becoming a true partner of the Russian state 
 2. Theory/hypotheses: the ROC worldview and its foreign policy potential
	 1. the Christian doctrine of church-state relations was first codified in the Eastern Roman Empire gives it several specific characteristics. 
	 2. The pattern of church-state relations that emerged in the East presumed that the Patriarch and Basileus continued to work together to accomplish God’s purpose on Earth. 
	 3. As described in Roman Emperor Justinian’s (482-565) Sixth Novella, their respective spheres of competence might overlap, but remained distinct ***symphonia***, or harmony, between religious and state institutions Peter the Great’s reign created, Lutheran consistory to supervise the ROC, 
	 4. Peter subordinated the church entirely, mark end of ***symphonia*** intellectual elite drifted away from the weakened and socially isolated post-Petrine Church, embracing Western ideas that seemed to provide solutions to Russia’s backwardness Bolsheviks interpreted Marx’s indictment of religion 
	 5. Recent years church grown leading to seven-fold increase in corporate philanthropy, and a level of social activity that has made the Russian Orthodox Church “the largest and most authoritative social institution in contemporary Russia” (Anishyuk 2011, ‘Slovo Svyateishego Patriarkha Kirilla’ 2016). The rise of Orthodoxy has thus been good not only for business, but for political stability as well. 
		 1. First in stead of the separation of church and state, there should be a “separation of sphere of competencies.” 
		 2. Second, spiritual and secular authorities should cooperate in areas of common interest and mutual benefit. 
		 3. Third, whereas in the past the Church has been relatively passive, today it needs to be more assertive and work alongside the government to create a healthy spiritual and moral social climate, social peace and solidarity. 
	 6. *shared spheres of competencies include* 
		 1. concern for the moral upbringing of young people, support for the institution of the family, fighting drug addiction, alcoholism and other dangerous vices, preventing crimes, caring for those in prisons, preserving cultural inheritance, overcoming national and religious intolerance, assisting the preservation of social peace and harmony, opposing the rise of radical and extremist attitudes, opposing pseudo-religious movements, helping to resolve international conflicts, promoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue both within the state and globally, as well as in international organizations” 
	 7. religion in diplomacy and to assist in the construction of a multipolar world that respects diverse cultural worldview
		 1. Foreign policy
			 1. Improving the situation of Orthodox churches around the globe; 
			 2. Improving contacts with Russians living abroad; 
			 3. Expanding the dialogue of religious communities in Russia with state structures and international organizations; 
			 4. Promoting a positive image of Russia, its history, culture and religion abroad.
		 2. Example
			 1. relations with Georgia
			 2. ROC opposed the wishes of Russian state, which was promoting the territorial, cultural, and religious autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia
		 3. ROC provides intellectual and moral support to state policies not because it has to, but because it wants to - **eschatological mission to save souls**
		 4. three main features of Western culture—consumerism, individualism, and secularism
			 1. Putin intends to counter this trend by defending Christian moral principles, both at home and abroad - culture war 
			 2. happens to align with eschatological goals
		 5. **Overlap of values**
			 1. first, sovereignty or  "spiritual freedom;" 
			 2. second, a strong and socially protective state that is capable of defending  that sovereignty; and 
			 3. third, cultural loyalty to those who share Russia's sense of honor, wherever  they may be.
3. How the ROC influences Russian foreign policy: the case of Russki mir
	1. russky” in “Russky mir” is neither a geographical nor an ethnic concept. It is a spiritual identity born in the cradle civilization of Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarussians, support of russian Orthodox outside of Russia's border
	2. Russky mir is a typical public relations initiative. It strives to popularize Russia and the use of Russian abroad. It is an element of Russia’s “soft power,
	3. second christianization 
	4. Ukraine
		1. Putin constructed a narrative that portrayed the annexation of Crimea as both a defense against imminent threats to the Russian identity of this region
		2. "spiritual source of the formation of our multifaceted but **monolithic Russian nation** and centralized Russian state. It was in this very place, in **Crimea, in ancient Khersones**, or as Russian chroniclers called it, Korsun, that Prince Vladimir was baptized, and he then baptized all of Rus"
	5. Although effort to politicize the religious meaning of the Russky mir (“against the will of its  authors,” as Denysenko notes) appear to be inflaming national and religious animosity, the ROC
	6. Church shows no sign yet of abandoning the concept of mir even when politicized. 
		1. Nation-states are neither good nor bad per se. current framework within which God intends the Church to accomplish the restoration of Holy Rus spiritual complement to national sovereignty-- one that allows people to see their common heritage
		2. **Whereas the state seeks to promote Russian national interest and culture, the ROC seeks to promote the larger identity and culture associated with Kievan Rus. This distinction, which is the result of a theologically steeped view of how the current conflict needs to be resolved**
4. ROC as a source of future conflict
	1. Russian Orthodox Church does not see itself as just one constituency among many in society. It is, rather, the very “soul of the people and, at its deepest level the Church represents its people externally
	2. The ROC therefore cannot support policies, no matter how socially beneficial, that results in movement away from its ideal of Holy Rus.
	3. ROC support for government policy is conditional upon its judgement about the spiritual benefits of that policy broadly harmonious and mutually supportive relations between Church and state in Russia
		1. become a source of conflict with the West, for they lead to conclusions that some in the West find troubling
	4. Vladimir Putin’s high popularity ratings derive in part from his very public embrace of religion, then both Putin’s unpopularity in the West and his extraordinarily high levels of support in Russia, stem from the same source--the popularity of the traditional social values being advocated by the ROC.
	5. Russia was pushed away from Europe both conceptually and practically after the fall of the berlin wall, eastern and western drift
	6. we should never lose sight of the fact that the Church sees itself, first and foremost, as a supernatural actor, a tangible manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the world

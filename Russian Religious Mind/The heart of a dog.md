### The Heart of a Dog - a monstrous story

Written in 1925 
after the civil war, some social division
Moscow, religious reference to 'Prechistenka street' immaculate 'preobrazhensky' transfigurator - theosis
philip - one who likes horses, horsemen of appocalypse, 
philipovich - father's name same, father son relationship
cold weather - late fall near winter, snowstorm: moaning >> howling >> violent blizzard >> like gunfire
	everything is fuzzy and chaotic, apocalyptic overtones, common metaphor for the russian revolution
Positivist, Utilitarian, contrast to Christ's view of the world

Professor's meal with the Dr. , 
	Narration focuses on food
	callback to focus on lack of food on the streets
	government involvement in food depravity, cause of social tension
	bondage of human being, confined to looking for food
		food placates Sharik
		not afraid because he has enough to eat
		"Christ, My God, to Hell" expletives
		"the mere smell has rejuvenated me", "oh master, look at me, I'm dying, I'll be your slave forever"
		"immaculate personage" - he thinks of the professor "you saved my life" "a great magician" 
			magic vs miracles
			human (mysterious) vs divine (pure)
		collar - confined, chained, but treated differently, has a premonition that something bad is happening, "remembered a scene from his earliest youth" "I'm a gentleman's dog now, an intelligent being, I've tasted better things. Anyhow, what is freedom? Vapour, mirage, fiction"
		
NEP (New economic policy) - to recover from the economic consequences of the civil war, had to introduce some capitalist ideology to rebuild the economic, little more relaxed on free entrepreneurship, relative prosperity
"eugenics" used to be understood as a dream of human societal evolution, also tried to alter the aging process

"You'll get nowhere with an animal if you use terror, no matter what its level of development may be"

intelligentsia class against the monarchy, ended up using terror in the violence of the civil war, they were hoping to achieve a nice end with terror. Wanted to change the life of the proletariat, didn't have much high opinion of the people they were trying to help. 

hormones and food control the physical
"hawk-like nose" "butcher" "priest"

people that acquired new wealth because of the change, acted entitled to things like an aristocrat, 
"acquired his final title to divinity"



### God v Man
magic v mystery
mastery of science and its distortion because of hubris
make believe, pretend, magic and sorcery as opposed to mystery and miracles
the kitchen - warm and with food / cold and hungry in the past
also symbolism of hell
### Creation v Anti-creation
narrator ambiguity
	the professor is the sympathetic character, not portrayed as the outright villian
	shifting narrative perspective 
juxtaposition of artificial lighting and "priest" "deity"
description of Sharik a the work of the devil 
### Social Commentary of the Revolution
creation of the next evolution of humanity, unnatural, trying to play god, Neumann social engineering, creating a new breed of human species.
guaranteeing a new social order that is fairer and more just
	wanted equality, better for all 
positivist
	only that which we prove with experimentation we can rely on
	rationalism
	utilitarian
	Bolshevik ethics
	if you satisfies everyone's basic needs, this guarantees freedom, the paradise on earth that can be achievable by human hands, the "master" "divinity" justify doing almost anything to achieve an idea
freedom being associated with satiation of material wants
about any kind of ideology, thinking that if there is nothing outside of the human being that dictates morality, can arrive at the conclusion that suicide is the ultimate freedom, as no one can control your life. 
Professor uses material needs to lure Sharik, then proceeding to perform violent things like the surgery, even through he professes that he uses kindness to get Sharik.

How the professor does not take responsibility for creation
Bolsheviks, having best intensions, not taking responsibility for their actions, experimentation on the masses in the name of humanity.

Revolutionaries had a lot of contempt for the very people that they were trying to change things for. Like Professor's commentary on the poor that "do not even know how to button their shirt"

Scientific experimentation and ethics

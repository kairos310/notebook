Divine Folly

Existential embodiment of the Orthodox ideal of passionless-ness (self-abnegation)
Reflects Christ's life on earth, one of poverty and persecution, suffer in the same way that Christ suffered
Reflects ascetic monks, have to give up material possession's, ultimate form of asceticism, self abnegation, 


foundational text -> Corinthians -> letter from Paul, about earthly wisdom is meaningless, wisdom on earth isn't considered wisdom for God. In the afterlife earthly wisdom does not matter, they, with their behavior, expose the otherworldly truth. Exposes the hypocrisy of convention, challenges authority, the wrongs and hypocrisies of those in power, they metaphorically also showed the sinfulness of human beings, "this is how you appeared to God" in your sinfulness 
Surrender their minds to God, pretending to be mad, out of their mind, it's feigned, distinguish them from actual mental illness, which is ambiguous, sign of the devil to remove wisdom, but mentally ill people are considered touched by God. 
Holy foolishness deals with the paradox of holy foolishness, try to lead people into temptation. 
	by seeing a holy fool, recognition of what the holy fool is doing
	compassion, crying, caring, providing for them
	ridiculed, lack of compassion, humiliating
		shows that they are not being Christian
		to be persecuted is the imitation of Christ, they need to sustain abuse from others, meaningful because of this
			Christ could only save humanity by having to be persecuted, killed
			

Existed in Europe before it became prevalent in Russia

# Ivan the terrible
Trying take over,
people came to appease him
one man, came naked and gave Ivan the terrible a piece of raw flesh, "why is it a sin to eat meat on a holy day but not one to eat other people (referring to the massacre)" - Nicholas , during the time holy fools were revered and canonized, he was spared. 



# St. Basil the Blessed

Holy foolishness is significantly important to culture, for how they view themselves. 
The blessed fools are the ideal.

St. Basil
Ivan the terrible carried his corpse
16, gift of clairvoyance
predicted someones death 
threw stones at icon of the mother of God, people were mad but when they took it down they saw a picture of satan
was wearing a furcoat once, people tried to trick the coat off him as he wasn't supposed to have a coat, told him that someone died and needed the coat for the funeral, he went to the person that was pretending he was dead, placed the furcoat on him and predicted his death
he would go to the marketplace and mess things up but others would later find he was targeting those who were deceptive with their goods 

# Orthodox Spirituality
sin is the cause of all conflicts
reconciliation, one must undergo a process of inner change that results in a restoration of God's image in man
change starts from oneself, focus is always on changing yourself, not imposing change on others, if everyone thinks this way, reconciliation on the societal level can occur, if not, this will end in some sort of bloodshed, imposing beliefs is the basis of conflicts, this moves away from God's will to human will
self abnegation of: 
	names
		holy fools never name themselves
	possessions
		holy fools carry nothing to them
	faculty of speech
	reason

weakness is false, God's weakness on the cross is stronger than humanity's strength

Paul catalogues afflictions deprived of everything that beset the apostles outlining fool for Christ.
Feigned madness as an act of self humiliation and provocative behavior 
position of marginality in society, centrality in the discourse of the mainstream culture
performative dimension

version of *kenosis*, even in realization of privilege, didn't use it

self-abasement and self-abnegation but also holiness and charity, simultaneous existence of both 
different perspective according to the wisdom of the other world
being one with God, is to give up what defines a human being materialistically
spiritual pain, recognition of ones own sin, that elevates one to a spiritually higher place

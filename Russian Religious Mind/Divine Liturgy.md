Create experience of unity with everyone else and Christ
Becoming one with God, deification through the consumption of his blood and flesh

### Eucharist
**subsisting in a manner different from the biological**
	existing in a liminal space between the physical and the spiritual
	transition to becoming part of God, what we *would become*
**transcends exclusiveness of a biological/ social kind**
	biological/ social exclusiveness -> what makes us unique, discreet
	other type of existence after life is continuous and united
**ecclesiastical identity**
	future self
**by the victory not of the evolution of the human race**
	will never be able to achieve that state of being by our of means

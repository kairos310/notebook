1. **What is the function of icons in the Russian Orthodox belief system?** 
	*Icons are faith given shape and body (something that is not of this world, something that "will be" manifestation of other worldliness, brings the kingdom of God, overlaps with Divine Liturgy), serve to connect the devoted viewer to the divine to channel their energy, this separates it from a piece of art. Icons use reverse perspective to place emphasis on the viewer. Material things can become carriers of the divine because Christ sanctified all material things.*
2. **Explain how humility, love, asceticism, compassion, obedience to good authority, forgiveness, charity – all important principles of Orthodox spirituality – are connected.**
	*Humility is the central idea in Orthodoxy, think of oneself less. Love is the ultimate expression of humility, looking outside of oneself and to others, having compassion for everyone, even your enemies, which is the ultimate form of love. Humility recognizes one's inadequacy and thus allows mistakes, looking towards good authority for advice. Autonomy is paired with ego and community with obedience. This makes one think one oneself less, and thus care less about the material pleasures surrounding oneself, forming the basis of asceticism. Charity and compassion, derive from the outward looking love. Charity regulates social relations, not shameful to receive help, expect to give, sustains cohesiveness. * 
3. **How does veneration of Christ and Mother of God factor relate to the main spiritual elements of Orthodoxy (love, compassion, humility, etc.)?** 
	*The veneration of Christ and Mother of God looks outside oneself towards the divine. It becomes a direction one can pour love into. Mother of God also embodies compassion, especially in eleusa, the icon of tender mercy.* 
4. **Why do you think the family metaphor (father-son, mother, children of God) has been adopted for religious descriptions?** 
	*The familial love and bond is fundamental to the type of love one should have with others in this community and with God. Unconditional love, closeness to to the divine unlike the master and servant relationship in other religions, tangible understanding of what this love is like, loving with all their faults. Brothers and sisters in God, all loved by God.* 
5. **Name several spiritual practices associated with Russian Orthodoxy (activities, institutions that manifest adherence to and practice of Orthodox beliefs).**
	*Prayer (communication with God, praise, thankfulness, confession, repentance, asking for guidance, submission to will, honesty, prayer with ceasing) --> forgiveness, allowing one to move on, "keep your mind in hell but despair not" because of forgiveness. asceticism -- > fasting, vows of silence, holy foolishness.
	Divine liturgy, the community, church, have to be part of sobornost. *
6. **Explain the role and meaning of prayer for Orthodox believers. What is contemplative prayer? Why praying without ceasing is important for ascetic practice?**
	*Bringing yourself to a state where you're feeling that unity with the divinity, shutting out all other senses, waiting for forgiveness of the divine. Prayer of the head becomes prayer of the heart, repetition of one thing "Jesus Christ, son of God, forgive me the sinner. " Tunes ones to constant connection and asking for forgiveness, spiritual pain. * 
7. **How is the aesthetic principle manifested in Russian Orthodoxy?**
	*Beauty in architecture, liturgical object, decorative elements of church, attire. Opulence and beauty of all things that adorn, praise of God, and his kingdom. Beauty is the carrier truth and goodness.*
8. **Would you say that Orthodoxy is human-centered or God-centered? Compromise-seeking or consensus-seeking? Explain.**
	*God-centered, everyone one does is for God. Consensus-seeking, coming together as a group, everything is agreeable, everyone is on equal terms, compromise implies one's gain and loss* 
9. **Why is tradition and fidelity to norm/form important in the system of Orthodox faith?**
	*Orthodox means "correct", introduced son of God. Stay "true". Fidelity to tradition, continue that which was. Tradition creates unified structure and identity that is perpetuated, doesn't allow reinterpretations which puts human intervention in what was already established. Minimize human innovation, contamination of origin.*
10. Faith, religion and chruch. 
	The belief, the institutionalized systems with theology and dogma, the building. 
	
11. Explain the significance of the Divine Liturgy – what it is and what meaning it has for the faithful.
	Experience that which will be, what is not of this world, the kingdom of God.

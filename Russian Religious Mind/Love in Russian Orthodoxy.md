family metaphor
highest form of love
emphasis on love 
	separating humanity from anything else
		not something natural
			humans are material as well as spiritual
	contrasts ego, focus on the *other*
	builds cohesiveness 
	
loving one's enemy 
	unnatural, have to make an effort
Paradise on earth achieved p.31

> "The lowly soul enjoys great peace, while the proud soul is a torment to itself"

lowly - considers oneself imperfect and can sin
humility
	allows grace towards oneself
		allows mistakes,
	following God's will
		no matter what you do, it has meaning, don't have to go through the mental torture of is what I'm doing right?
	without ego, can't be insulted, can't be hurt
	need some ego to be autonomous, just tamed in this spiritual struggle

freedom in following God's will? equality? 
	freedom from material desires
	freedom from fear of death
	freedom from abandonment
freedom in the traditional sense
	do whatever you want
		physical constraints 
		circumstances 
		other people's freedom
		conflicts of freedom
	leads to **isolation** **disintegration** of society
		connection with people severed when everyone is individualistic
	boredom 
		experienced everything
		need reinforcement to feel alive
		overstimulation
suicide
	selfishness, lack of meaning, ultimate act of self assertion, autonomy
Something external to measure oneself to

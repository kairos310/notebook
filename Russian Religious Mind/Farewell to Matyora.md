### Darya

	"most ridiculous answer. They put it there—and you can burst if you want! It was as if, the way they did in fairy tales, they shot an arrow in the air and went wherever the wind carried it.

	"Despite her years, Darya stood on her own feet, controlled her hands, and managed the work involved in running the house. "

	"Darya lived with the same fear as the others, but she lived more confidently and seriously, she was respected by her son, not the least important man in the sovkhoz, and she had a place to lay her head after the flood, even with a choice: if she wanted, she could go in one direction, and if she wanted, in another; and besides, Darya had a temper, which didn't mellow or weaken with the years, and if it came to that, she could stand up for more than just herself. "

### Veneration of ancestors

opening
	"out into a mighty, sparkling flow. Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island's upper tip, before cascading down both channels of the riverbed; once more greenery flared on the
	ground and in the trees, the first rains soaked the earth, the swifts and swallows flew back, and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life. It all had happened many times
	before, and many times Matyora had been caught up in nature's changes, neither falling behind nor running ahead of each day." 
Cyclic and eternal
	"thundered down" perfected, interrupted the cycle, "from that point on the village would be no more", linear from that point on, no longer returned back to where it was
Interrupted
	inevitable, everything comes toward a particular end
	techniques 
		repetition "once again" "once more"
		traditionality, continuity, cyclicality
		thundered down on them, imperfective verb, one time single event "the village will be no more" borrows from the poetic nature of the folklore genre
		inevitability of the particular end after the cyclic beginning is interrupted
Respect of the dead and graves
	remembrance of the past, heritage, tradition
	continuity
	The last generation's responsibility to make sure that the land is passed on in good condition, and that it's being passed on into good hands, moral responsibility. 
	Physical land is a mutualistic relationship 

### Folklore

lesovik is a male woodland spirit, a shapeshifter, in slavic mythology who protects wild animals and forests. Taking the form of a plant, animal but typical human like with glowing eyes, with shoes backward. Can lead peasants astray 

##### Bogodul - leshy
Forest spirit
	For many years they knew Bogodul as an ancient old man, and for many years he hadn't changed, remaining just as he had appeared, as though God had decided to keep at least one man alive through several generations. He was still on his feet, stepping slowly and broadly, with a heavy, rolling gait, bending his back and lifting his large shaggy head, in which sparrows could easily have nested. The impenetrable thickets on his face revealed only the knob of his bumpy nose and his glowing, bloodshot eyes. From snow to snow Bogodul walked barefoot, indifferent to stones and nettles; his feet, blackened and broad, had lost all semblance of skin; they were so hard they seemed petrified, as if bone had grown over the old bones. There was a time when the kids caught snakes: they trapped them with forked sticks on the ground, picked them up near the head, and ran to scare the girls and women; once he saw an escaped snake slithering down the road surrounded by jumping children, and Bogodul, without a second's thought, offered it his naked foot—the snake tried to bite it but couldn't, bumping against it as though it were rock. From that moment, the boys had found a new game: they brought all the snakes they caught to Bogodul, who would sit on

"them was wearing rang thinly, like a rattle. There, like the tsar o trees, towered a huge three-armsful around, centuries-old larch, with mighty branches that stuck straight out, and a crown that had been lopped off by a storm. Nearby stood a birch that looked as if it had been creeping up to it but stopped, either frightened by the larch's awesome appearance or dumbstruck by an execution; Darya remembered it well when it was young, a slim birch, and now its trunk had clumsily split in two, and the bark had hardened and started peeling, and the heavy branches drooped and bent down. "

"Your legs have been dancing a long time: where to now? Matyora is like the plague for you ... You didn't take root here and you won't take root anywhere, you'll never be sorry about anything. That's what you are ... fruitless seeds! "

"People forgot that they weren't alone, they lost one another and didn't need one another now. It's always like that: at an un- pleasant shameful event, no matter how many people are there, each tries not to notice anyone else and to remain alone—it's easier to rid yourself of the shame later. In their hearts they felt bad, uncomfortable, that they stood motionless, that they hadn't tried when it was still possible to save the house, and that there was no point in trying. The same thing would happen to the other houses—soon—and Petrukha's was just the first. And they watched and watched, not missing a thing, to see how it was, to"

#### Love, Humility, Asceticism

**Humility**
	ego tamed
		free from the demands of the physical
		submission to God's will
		suffering
	asceticism
		easier to ignore one's own wants
	easier to love
		salvation is not about *deserving* 
		love of enemies
			no contractual basis of love
			it's not something that comes naturally, not rational, not a logical explanation, highest form of love 
		transfer of attention from ourselves to the other - humility

Asceticism -> Transfiguration -> Salvation
	recognition of sin
spiritual pain
	realization of own imperfection and smallness
God loves even in sin, especially if you try to arrest sin and be humble

prayer of the mind -> prayer of the heart
repetition till it becomes innate, unaware of the prayerful mode in which one lives



- Essential to monasticism -> acceptance/ acknowledge of one's sin
- Fear of God -> fear of disappointing God
- Knowing God -> love of God, human beings, enemies, all creation 
	- this is a sign that you've filled with the Holy Spirit
	- Emphasis on knowing instead of believing
		- **knowing** - takes effort, aided by the Holy Spirit, show acts of love
		-  **belief** - can convince themselves that God exists, don't practice

- "keep your mind in hell, but despair not"
	- Contrite hearts arrests sin, keeping a state of prayerful humility and repentance
- prayer without ceasing
	- prayer continuously, not through speech but through living in a prayerful state
	- prayer of the mind in the heart
- tears/ weeping
	- longing for the connection before Adam
	- softening of the heart, become more receptive to God's wisdom and to others
	- relief and confession, freeing from the burden's of your sins
- silence
	- verbosity suggests deviation from diving truth
	- the thought that is verbalized is always somewhat untrue
	- silence shows the true thought in the mind
- forgiveness
	-  forgive others, being ready to accept forgiveness comes from humility
- cocreating
	- add to what God created

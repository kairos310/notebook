	is Anthropogenic, easiest seen through deforestation

Non Anthropogenic change
- can be caused by circulation patterns in the deep ocean
- lots of dissolved CO2
- rises up released into atmosphere causing warming


Climate is a good example that shows the overlap of short and long time scales to global change
Without human influence it would have slipped into the ice age over the next thousand years. 

[[The Earth System]]

**The Keeling Curve**
- measurements that signified that the climate was changing
- measures CO2 ppm

**CO2 Levels**
- levels increase significantly since 1958
- caused by combustion of fossil fuels and tropical deforestation
- warming corresponds to rise in CO2
	- warming doesn't increase as uniformly as CO2
	- through time and geographically
		- cities can raise temperatures by up to 3^c
		- coverage and accuracy can range between places
	- warming is much more apparent near the North Pole. 

**CFCs**
- *freons*
- Chlorine Fluorine Carbon
	- destruction of ozone

**KT boundary**
- K Cretaceous
- T Tertiary
- clay layer with high abundance of iridium

## The carbon cycle

##### organic carbon
$C-H$
$C-C$
eg. Photosynthesis: $CO_{2}+H_{2}O \rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + O_{2}$
	turning inorganic carbon into organic carbon

##### inorganic carbon
eg. $CO_2$

Photosynthesis, respiration, weathering and erosion, decomposition

##### Reservoirs and Processes and Fluxes
the largest reservoirs don't typically have the largest flux
largest carbon reservoir - limestone consisting of calcite and dolomite
residence time = $$\frac{reservoir\ size\ at\ steady\ state}{flux\ out}$$

Primary production = amount of light energy converted to chemical energy by autotrophs

##### Factors that affect primary producer productivity 
seasons
temperature
atmospheric CO2 
sunlight
soil quality
weather/ moisture


Warmer temperatures hold less CO2
this creates a positive feedback loop where warmer temperatures release more CO2
$$CO_2+H_2O\rightarrow H_2CO_2$$


# Light

Wein's law
$$\lambda_{max}=\frac{2898\micro m}{T}$$
Luminosity - total energy emitted by an object in each second, measured in watts.
Flux 
	- luminosity per unit area, W
	- depends on temperature 
	- Stefan Boltzmann: $F=\sigma T^4$
	- hot objects have more flux

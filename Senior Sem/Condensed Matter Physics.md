Atomic spacing of crystals determined through x-ray crystalography



Crystals are typically held together at fixed angles, 
the advent of 2D materials, creating tight bonds within a single layer allowed these 2D films to be bonded by the VanderWaals force alone, this allowed scientists to stack them at any arbitrary angle


1.1 degrees
researchers found, created just the right periodicity to allow graphene to function as a superconductor between layers at sufficiently low temperatures, turned into an insulator without a magnetic field

# Hubbard Model

The Hubbard model states that each electron experiences competing forces:
	one pushes it to tunnel to neighboring atoms, while the other pushes it away from its neighbors

Its Hamiltonian thus has two terms: a kinetic term allowing for tunneling ("hopping") of particles between lattice sites and a potential term reflecting on-site interaction. The particles can either be fermions, as in Hubbard's original work, or bosons, in which case the model is referred to as the "Boseâ€“Hubbard model".
$$H=-t\sum_{i,j,\sigma}c_{i}^{\dagger}c_{j,\sigma}+U\sum\limits_{i}{n_{i}\uparrow,n_i\downarrow}$$

# VanDerWalls Heterostructures
A heterojunction is an interface between two layers or regions of dissimilar semiconductors. These semiconducting materials have unequal band gaps as opposed to a homojunction. It is often advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid-state device applications, including semiconductor lasers, solar cells and transistors.

# The Search for Superconductivity

 Pablo Jarillo-Herrero and colleagues now show that when two graphene sheets are twisted by a certain angle they exhibit unconventional superconductivity, with features similar to high-temperature superconducting cuprates. This system can easily be tuned through both the twist angle and electric fields, so could provide a new two-dimensional platform for understanding the origin of high-temperature superconductivity.

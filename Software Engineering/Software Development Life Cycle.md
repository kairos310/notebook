### Software development life cycle
1. Concept
	1. wireframes
	2. storyboards
2. Requirements
	1. what you need
	2. need oriented analysis
	3. from the perspective of a client of the system
	4. requirement docs --> user stories
		1. what kinds of users are there of a system
		2. want some functionality
		3. As a (user) I want some (functionality) so that (I can do something)
		4. does not specify how
	5. Minimum Viable Product
3. Analysis 
	1. impact analysis
		1. equipment cost 
		2. how much a modification can affect a client 
		3. hyrums' law
		4. hardware needs, 
		5. human
		6. feasibility
		7. backlog grooming
4. Design/ Architecture
	1. select frameworks, technologies, and language

			2. n-tier 
				1. presentation layer
				2. business layer
				3. data layer
			3. message - passing
			4. publisher - subscriber
	2. high level solutions
		1. design connectivity of components

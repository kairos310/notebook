the **central** part of the operating system that manages system resources and provides services to applications.

The kernel is responsible for **translating virtual memory addresses** used by applications into **physical memory addresses** used by the system's hardware. It also manages the allocation and deallocation of memory pages and provides mechanisms for inter-process communication and synchronization.

The kernel resides in a **protected area of memory** that is inaccessible to user-level processes to prevent unauthorized access and modification of critical system resources.

In a virtual memory system, the kernel is loaded into physical memory when the system boots up and remains there until the system shuts down. The kernel code and data are typically shared among all processes, allowing for efficient use of memory resources.

OS fills out page table data structures

### page table
one entry for every word in virtual address - $2^{30}$
##### translation 
divide memory into pages, chunks. each entry can map a few kB of data. 
have to move a whole page at a time, so the larger the page the slower. 

the offset in the physical and virtual stays the same, this doesn't get translated. 
page number gets translated

The complete physical address of the memory cell is determined by combining the page address from the page directory with the low bits from the virtual address
**page address**:
| page address | low bits from physical address | access permission |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |

1. processor determines address of the highest level directory
2. takes the index of virtual address, picks the appropriate entry
3. this entry is the address of the next directory
4. üîÅ repeats until the last process 

Each process has its own page table tree, not all programs use all 4 levels.
the complete computation of addresses of physical page is cached into the [[TLB]]

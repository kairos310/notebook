For Wed, 1 Mar: TES 3, Critical-Thinking Problems #1, 2, 5


1. 
	a. Given that a 300-K blackbody radiates its peak energy at a wavelength of about 10 Âµ,m, at what wavelength would a 600-K blackbody radiate its peak energy? 
		$$\lambda_{max} \approx \frac{2898\micro m \cdot K }{300K}=10\micro m$$$$\lambda_{max} \approx \frac{2898\micro m}{600K}\approx 5\micro m$$
	b. If the two bodies in part (a) were the same size, what would be the ratio of the heat emitted by the hotter object to the heat emitted by the colder one?
		$$F=\sigma T ^ 4$$$$\frac{\sigma 600 ^ {4}}{\sigma 300 ^ {4}} =16\ times$$

2. 
	a. Venus and Mars orbit the Sun at average distances of 0.72 and 1.52 AU, respectively. What is the solar flux at each planet? 
		
	b. Venus has a planetary albedo of 0.8, and Mars has an albedo of 0.22. Using the answer to part (a), determine the effective radiating temperatures of these planets. 
	
	c. How do the effective radiating temperatures determined in part (b) compare with the value for Earth, and why is this result surprising? 
	d. The mean surface temperatures of Venus and Mars are 730 and 218 K, respectively. Using the answer to part (b), determine the magnitude of the greenhouse effect on each planet. 
	e. How do the results of ( d) compare with the magnitude of the greenhouse effect on Earth?

5. Solar luminosity is estimated to have been 30% lower than today at the time when the solar system formed, 4.6 billion years ago.
	a. If Earth's albedo was the same as it is now (A = 0.3) , what would have been its effective radiating temperature at that time? 
	b. If the magnitude of the greenhouse effect had also remained unchanged (LiTg = 33 K) , what would Earth's average surface temperature have been? How does this compare with today's value?

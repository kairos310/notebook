Made of **couplings** and **components**

## Coupling
![[Drawing 2023-01-30 10.19.24.excalidraw]]
When there's an **even** number of positive couplings, it's **positive** feedback loop, when it's **odd** it's **negative** feedback loop.
Negative feedback loops are **stable**. Sine waves are stable equilibrium
Positive feedback loops are **unstable**.

## Components
What a system consists of

## Forcing
persistent disturbance of a system

## Perturbations 
temporary disturbance of a system
typically what happens in a feedback loop

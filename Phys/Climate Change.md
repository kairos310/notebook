 is Anthropogenic, easiest seen through deforestation

Non Anthropogenic change
- can be caused by circulation patterns in the deep ocean
- lots of dissolved CO2
- rises up released into atmosphere causing warming


Climate is a good example that shows the overlap of short and long time scales to global change
Without human influence it would have slipped into the ice age over the next thousand years. 

[[The Earth System]]

**The Keeling Curve**
- measurements that signified that the climate was changing
- measures CO2 ppm

**CO2 Levels**
- levels increase significantly since 1958
- caused by combustion of fossil fuels and tropical deforestation
- warming corresponds to rise in CO2
	- warming doesn't increase as uniformly as CO2
	- through time and geographically
		- cities can raise temperatures by up to 3^c
		- coverage and accuracy can range between places
	- warming is much more apparent near the North Pole. 

**CFCs**
- *freons*
- Chlorine Fluorine Carbon
	- destruction of ozone

**KT boundary**
- K Cretaceous
- T Tertiary
- clay layer with high abundance of iridium

## The carbon cycle

##### organic carbon
$C-H$
$C-C$
eg. Photosynthesis: $CO_{2}+H_{2}O \rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + O_{2}$
	turning inorganic carbon into organic carbon

##### inorganic carbon
eg. $CO_2$

Photosynthesis, respiration, weathering and erosion, decomposition

##### Reservoirs and Processes and Fluxes
the largest reservoirs don't typically have the largest flux
largest carbon reservoir - limestone consisting of calcite and dolomite
residence time = $$\frac{reservoir\ size\ at\ steady\ state}{flux\ out}$$

Primary production = amount of light energy converted to chemical energy by autotrophs

##### Factors that affect primary producer productivity 
seasons
temperature
atmospheric CO2 
sunlight
soil quality
weather/ moisture


Warmer temperatures hold less CO2
this creates a positive feedback loop where warmer temperatures release more CO2
$$CO_2+H_2O\rightarrow H_2CO_2$$


# Light

Wein's law
$$\lambda_{max}=\frac{2898\micro m}{T}$$
Luminosity - total energy emitted by an object in each second, measured in watts.
Flux 
	- luminosity per unit area, W
	- depends on temperature 
	- Stefan Boltzmann: $F=\sigma T^4$
	- hot objects have more flux

# Planetary Balance
### Energy In == Energy Out

$\sigma$ = Stefan - Boltzmann constant = $5.67 \times 10^{-18}W/m^2/K^4$
$T_e$=Earth's effective temperature
S = Solar insolation = $S\pi R^2$
A =Earth's albedo ~ 0.3
$$energy\ in = energy\ out$$
$$S\pi R^{2} - SA \pi R^{2} = \sigma T^{4}_{e}$$
$$\sigma T^4_e=\frac{S}{4}(1-A)$$

The atmosphere absorbs based on its spectrum
Earth's atmosphere transmits visible light but absorbs IR due to greenhouse gases
In steady state, planetary energy balance means Solar energy striking Earth = energy reflected + emitted b the Earth. 
**The greenhouse effect:** The upper levels of the atmosphere
400ppm carbon dioxide in the atmosphere


Venus - 96% carbon dioxide, the runaway greenhouse effect 
global average surface temp - 300 - 400 c 

Net Down - radiative forcing from greenhouse effect.
radiative forcing 

**Global Warming Potential**
<div class="def" value="#rem">index measuring radiative forcing following emission of unit mass of a given substance over a chosen time, relative to carbon dioxide. combined effect of the differing times  these substances remain in the stratosphere. effectiveness in radiative forcing. </div>


Other greenhouse gasses
- methane 
- nitrous oxide
- surface ozone
- fluorinated gasses
	- HFCs, PFCs, $SF_6$, $NF_3$
	- *halocarbons* - compounds containing carbon, halogens and sometimes hydrogen
	- also greenhouse gasses
	- destroy ozone - HCFC
	- regulated by *Montreal protocol*
	- Kigali Amendment - bans HFC

### Methane
2nd strongest anthropogenic greenhouse gas
25 x more potent than $CO_2$
most of it comes from leakage, because the ratio is large

### Nitrous Oxide
- food production/ agriculture
- oceanic - algae bloom due to nitrogen runoff
- microbes - nitrogen fixing bacteria can take nitrogen from the atmosphere sone create methane



### Pressure
Gradient of the pressure opposes gravity. 
$$\frac{pressure}{ height}=\frac{dP}{dh}=-\rho g$$
M - molar mass of air
$$P=\frac{\rho RT}{M}$$
$$P=P_{0} e^{\frac{-h}{h_{0}}}$$
$$\frac{-h}{h_{0}} \rightarrow scale\ height$$
how much the pressure decreases with h_0
temperature increases up to the mesosphere because of ozone, then decreases once entering the mesosphere at the freezing point of water

cold air has higher pressure, higher density moves downwards. 
*vertical motion*
**convective uplift** or **subsidence**
convective -> circulatory patterns due to air replacing the missing air due to movement
horizontal motion



percentage exposed to dangerous temperatures

geostrophic winds / currents
gyres - vortices in water that draws water to the middle due to Ekman transport, where the water currents are 90 deg to the surface winds


high to low pressure in atmosphere
high sea level to low sea level

Saltiness related to density related to depth correlated with temperature 
halocline - saltiness transition 
thermocline - temperature transition
